In the project focused on customer distribution using the K-means clustering technique, the primary goal is to segment customers into distinct groups based on shared characteristics. This approach is essential for businesses aiming to tailor their marketing strategies effectively.

Overview of Customer Segmentation:- Customer segmentation involves dividing a customer base into groups that exhibit similar traits, such as demographics, spending habits, and preferences. This process allows companies to understand their customers better and to design targeted marketing efforts that meet the specific needs of each segment. By leveraging data on factors like age, gender, annual income, and spending scores, businesses can identify valuable customer segments that maximize profitability and minimize marketing risks.

K-means Clustering Algorithm:- The K-means algorithm is a popular method for clustering unlabeled datasets. The process begins by selecting a predetermined number of clusters (k). Initial centroids are chosen randomly from the dataset, and each data point is assigned to the nearest centroid based on Euclidean distance. This assignment is followed by recalculating the centroids based on the current cluster members. The algorithm iterates this process until the cluster assignments stabilize, resulting in distinct customer segments.

Steps Involved in the Project:- ->Data Collection: The dataset, often sourced from platforms like Kaggle, typically includes features such as CustomerID, Gender, Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score. ->Data Preprocessing: This step involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and normalizing the features to ensure that the K-means algorithm performs optimally, here only the columns named-Annual Income and Spending Score is taken for the further processing. ->Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical analyses are conducted to understand the data distribution and relationships between variables. ->Applying K-means Clustering: The K-means algorithm is implemented to partition the dataset into k clusters. The choice of k can be determined using methods like the Elbow method or the Gap Statistic to find the optimal number of clusters, in this project elbow method is used. ->Cluster Interpretation: After clustering, each segment is analyzed to derive meaningful insights. For example, clusters may represent different customer profiles, such as high-income low-spenders or low-income high-spenders, allowing for tailored marketing strategies. ->Visualization of Results: The results are visualized using scatter plots to illustrate the distribution of customers across different clusters, aiding in the interpretation of the segmentation.
